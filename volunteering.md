# Volunteering
The ETES, like any TDS event, is run completely by it's participants: you. The fee that you pay is completely spend on things we have to rent, buy or arrange.
Running an event like an ETES is a _lot_ of work; the current estimage is 739 man-hours (almost 20 man-weeks!) and that excludes adjudicating, all the preparations done beforehand and the orga-team that will undoubtedly be working full-time during the event as well. 
Luckily we are with many hands to turn this task into light work. But it should be clear that we indeed need all those hands ;)

# Signing up for shifts
On this webpage: [https://etes2021.eu/shift-selector/]() (log in with your ETES-ID and password) you can see all the volunteering shifts that are needed. 
Shifts that are already taken have the ETES-ID of the person doing them in them, or an 'x' if the orga is recruiting specific people for them. Shifts currently claimed by you are hightlighted. Shift that are empty are up for grabs, you can select one by clicking it. A button will appear at the top of the page that says 'Claim <shift name> <shift timeslot>'. Hit the button and check the bottom of the screen for a confirmation message (it can take a few seconds). Your ETES-ID should appear in the shift you claimed.

# Shift priorities
As you will see, the shifts are color-coded. The color indicates how important it is that the shift gets fulfilled:
- Shifts in red are needed to make the event legal. If any of them is not filled the venue will have to be closed
- Orange shifts are essential to make the event run. Without them some aspects of the event will be severely impacted or impossible to execute. 
- Yellow shifts are important; without them there may be severe delays or other disturbances
- Green shifts are nice-to-have; without them there may be small delays, longer queues or someone will be doing a shift by themselves that is just nicer to share with a buddy.
Please keep these priorities in mind when choosing shifts. If we end up with high-priority shifts staying open while many low-priority shifts are getting taken we will have to re-assigning some shifts, starting with those participants that have the fewest high-priority shifts.
