# Location
The location of the event will be Candance Studios in Amsterdam. The address is Isolatorweg 28, 1014 AS Amsterdam.

Parking in the area is for free between Friday 19:00 and Monday 09:00. Outside of those hours it is €0,10 per hour for the first three hours, after that it will be €3,50 per hour.
Detailed information can be found here: <https://www.amsterdam.nl/parkeren-verkeer/parkeertarieven/>. Use the search box to zoom in on the address.

You can also park at the nearby 'P+R Sloterdijk' parking lot for a special tariff of €1,00 per 24 hours and then travel 1 stop with Metroline 51 from the Sloterdijk Station to 'Isolatorweg', which is also it's final stop. Be sure to actually use the metro with your special P+R ticket, otherwise you will be charged the regular tariff which is €2,50 per hour! You can find information about parking in P+R, and see how many spots are available (there are not so many), here: <https://www.amsterdam.nl/parkeren-verkeer/parkeren-reizen/>

The venue is also very easy to reach by public transportation; from the Central Station you can take bus 22 towards Sloterdijk Station and get off at Kabelweg (in front of the Ibis hotel), or take metro line 51 to Isolatorweg (last stop); both stop at a few minutes walking from the venue. The bus will be faster and cheaper.
If you come by plane to Schiphol Airport the easiest way is to take a train from the airport to Amsterdam Sloterdijk station and take metro line 51 to Isolatorweg for 1 stop (which is the final stop).

# Corona protocol
The aim of our Corona protocol is that during the event we can all behave as freely as possible while providing a safe environment for everyone. To make that possible we will strictly apply the following regulations at the entrance:
- Every participant will be required to show proof of vaccination, recovery or a recent negative test for Covid-19, in accordance with local government regulations, at the registration desk.
- On top of that, proof of a recent negative official Covid-19 test will be required from every participant. This can not be a self-test and this requirement also applies to those fully vaccinated or recovered.


In practice this means that
- Everyone will need to get an official test at most 24 hours before you enter the event
- If you are not 'immunized' (either fully vaccinated or recoverd less than 180 days ago) you can probably plan it so that you can enter both Friday and Saturday with the same test, but you will need to get a new test to enter on Sunday.
- Every day when entering the venue for the first time you will need to show us a QR code that we can scan with the offical CoronaCheck scanner app, as well as a personal identification document. The scanner app needs to scan 'green' with your QR code, and the personal identification details shown in the scanner app need to match those in your official ID document.
- The QR code can be on paper or in one of the official apps (CoronaCheck for the Netherlands, CovPass-App for Germany)
- If you are using the app, make sure that you have everything set up before you come to the venue. It takes some steps to set up, and if you still have to do it when you appear at the welcome desk it will cause major delays for everyone
- On the first day you enter the venue you will also have to show us proof of your recent negative test.
- After these checks are done we will give you a wristband so that we won't have to repeat these checks for the rest of the day. Please keep your wristband on your arm until you get the new wristband when you enter the next day; that way we wont have to check the test report again and entering will be more smooth for everyone.
- Obviously, don't take of your wristband during the day. If you want to re-enter the venue without a wristband, we'll have to repeat the checkin procedure.


Rapid tests can be booked for free through this website: <https://www.testenvoortoegang.org/>. If you are curious, you can download the CoronaCheck scanner app yourself and see what it does.

We want you to be safe and also to feel safe. For the event, we are hoping for an atmosphere where no one will feel weird if they choose to wear a mask even on the dancefloor, even though this is nothing that we would ask you to do.
