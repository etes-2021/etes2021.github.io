Dear dancing family,

The marvels of '3030' seem to be even further away than we imagined. But, do not despair: we have found an oasis. A place where the bravest explorers of the time/space continu√ºm can settle down for a weekend, regroup with fellow travelers and stretch their legs.

Indeed, there will be a chance to dance and meet with those we've missed for too long after all! No, we will not have an ETDS. What we will have though is the very first ETES: our European Tournament for ETDS Superfans!

ETDS Superfan you say?
Yes. Because we are organizing this in the last minute and we are dealing with unique circumstances, not everything might be as polished as it would be in a 'real' ETDS: in the current situation it's impossible to provide sleeping halls, we don't have the time or the manpower to organize a full-fledged theme party, we will probably have to call for spontaneous volunteers every now and then and we can not even significantly reduce the paricipation fee because we have to pay for everything with much fewer participants, while there is no time to find sponsors. But what we do offer is a weekend filled with the pressence of those people who choose to deal with all of those inconveniences so that above all, we can finaly meet, have our tournament and enjoy the friendships that come with it. And that is why to us anyone who chooses to join this event, whether it's their first tango or they have been there from day one, truly deserves to be called an 'ETDS Superfan'.

As we are organizing this in the last minute not all the details are completely worked out yet, but here's what we can already tell you:
- On the dates you've already blocked in your agenda's: Friday 8th till Monday 11th of October 2021
- Location: Candance Studios in Amsterdam (Isolatorweg 28, 1014 AS Amsterdam)
- Tournaments for Beginners, Breitensport and Open class on Saturday and Sunday
- Dancing parties on Friday-, Saturday- and Sunday evenings
- Space for approximately 300 participants
- Participation fee: 70 euros. This will include most meals.
- There will be no sleeping halls. We are looking for alternative solutions, for which there would be a separate fee, but be prepared to arrange your own place to sleep.
- Every participant will be expected to take on 4 hours of helping shifts.

You can register by filling in the form here: <http://signup.etes2021.eu>

If more people sign up than we can host then there will be a randomized lottery. Those registrations selected by the lottery will be offered a spot in the event. The next draw of the lottery will be on September 20th, so make sure to register before that date! You as well as your team captain will be informed of the result of the lottery.
