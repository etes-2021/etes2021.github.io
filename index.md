Dear dancing family,

The marvels of '3030' seem to be even further away than we imagined. But, do not despair: we have found an oasis. A place where the bravest explorers of the time/space continu√ºm can settle down for a weekend, regroup with fellow travelers and stretch their legs.

Indeed, there will be a chance to dance and meet with those we've missed for too long after all! No, we will not have an ETDS. What we will have though is the very first ETES: our European Tournament for ETDS Superfans!

ETDS Superfan you say?
Yes. Because we are organizing this in the last minute and we are dealing with unique circumstances, not everything might be as polished as it would be in a 'real' ETDS: in the current situation it's impossible to provide sleeping halls, we don't have the time or the manpower to organize a full-fledged theme party, we will probably have to call for spontaneous volunteers every now and then and we can not even significantly reduce the paricipation fee because we have to pay for everything with much fewer participants, while there is no time to find sponsors. But what we do offer is a weekend filled with the pressence of those people who choose to deal with all of those inconveniences so that above all, we can meet, have our tournament and enjoy the friendships that come with it. And that is why to us anyone who chooses to join this event, whether it's their first tango or they have been there from day one, truly deserves to be called an 'ETDS Superfan'.
