# Partnering and (blind) dating
The ETES is all about improvisation. To keep things interesting, more advanced dancers are not allowed to dance with their regular competition- or training partners. There are several ways of pairing with a partner:
- Dancing with your own (practice) partner
- Dating: You can find a partner during the evening programme before the competition day. This can not be any of your own (former) competition- or training partners.
- Blind dating: Couples will be paired by lottery


Wether or not you are allowed to dance with your regular dancing partner is decided by the following rules:
- Beginners: Can dance with their own partner, but you can date if you want to
- Open class: Blind dating; you will be paired with a different partner for each dance
- Breitensport: Depending on your dancing level you can either dance with your own partner or you will have to date. If your dancing level is at least comparable to any of the following levels then you are not allowed to dance with your own (training) partner. You can find a partner for the competition by dating.

| Federation | Level |
|:-:|:-:|
| NADB(Netherlands) |	Debutants 2 |
| NVAD(Netherlands) |	Debutants 1 |

# Qualification rounds
Any class that has more than 24 couples will be divided into sub-classes by means of a qualification round. The number of subclasses will depend on the number of couples in the class.
